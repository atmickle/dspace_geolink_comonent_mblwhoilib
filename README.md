# dspace_geolink_comonent_mblwhoilib
The GeoLink component code used for the library's DSpace repository
This is the working code for our DSpace Repository GeoLink Component that searches for WHOI cruises in the subject tags. 
I am also working on a query for people. Feel free to copy this code and use in any way that is useful. 
This is far from perfect, so please don't put my javascript up on a large screen. I am not a professional coder. 

Note that the original geolink component code is available here: <https://github.com/geocomponents/geocomponents.github.io>.
If you would like to submit some work, please let us know. 
You can also email me if you would like to know more about what's in the GeoLink Linked Open Data and how you can use it.
